# Python-Based-Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show

In this project creates an image classifier to identify dog breeds. It is  focused on Python and not on the actual classifier but it uses an existince image classifier for classification. The application is build using the command line interface and accepts inputs to run and predict images



# Getting Started

For this image classification task you will be using an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images


### Predefined Archetectures Used

* AlexNet

* VGG

* RESNET



## Project Objectives

* Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs

* Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs


# Running the Application 

`Classifying Uploaded Images` - This section will help you test your program by classifying your own images
